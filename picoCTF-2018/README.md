Overview
========

PicoCTF was a very great experience for not-so-well experienced people like me. Being mainly focused on high school students, the competition was made up of mostly simpler tasks, serving as an excelent introduction to Capture The Flag. The harder ones however, turned out to be very interesting and challenging.

Tasks
=====

The tasks listed below are the all that I have managed to solve.
As there were a lot of them and most of the easy ones were not very complicated, I decided to prepare detailed write-ups only for the most interesting ones. (Keep in mind that some write-ups are still waiting to be written)


General
-------

Most of the general tasks are a simple introduction to linux. The write-ups for them would be pointless, as the hints already describe everything necessary.
